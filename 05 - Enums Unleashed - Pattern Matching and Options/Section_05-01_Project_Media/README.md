# Enums, Pattern Matching, and Options

This Rust project is dedicated to learning and exploring:
- **Enums**: Defining and using enumerations.
- **Pattern Matching**: Using `match` expressions to handle different data states.
- **Options**: Handling optional values safely with `Option<T>`.

## Getting Started

To run the project, ensure you have Rust installed and run:

```bash
cargo run
